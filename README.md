## Crypto Table
The project was written in React(tsx), it is using Mantine and tabler icons. 

To test you need to clone (please make sure you have the `.env` file in the backend folder) and `cd` into the backend folder and put the following command `npm i && npm start`. You will see the backend will run in port 4000. 
I created a variable called `PORT` to allow you to change it as required in `server.js`. If you decide to change the port please
remember to change it in `package.json` (`"proxy": "http://localhost:4000",`) in the frontend folder. <br/>
After the backend started in a separate tab you need to `cd` into the frontend and run the same command. You will see the frontend will run in port 3000.

Here are some screenshots for context:
